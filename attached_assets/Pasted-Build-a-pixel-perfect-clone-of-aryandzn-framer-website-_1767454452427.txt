Build a pixel-perfect clone of 'aryandzn.framer.website' with a sophisticated Client-Admin Chat System, using React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion for the frontend, and a Node.js/Express backend with Socket.IO for real-time chat functionality.

1. Core Visuals & Layout:

Theme: Ultra-clean, professional 'Modern Minimalist' theme with a pure white background and soft grey accents.

Branding: Place the text 'Digital Designer' in the exact center using a bold, premium sans-serif font (like Inter or Montserrat).

Navbar: On the top right, create three clean tabs: 'Home', 'About', 'Contact', and a new 'Chat' tab. The navigation should be sticky or follow a fixed header layout.

2. The Signature 3D Scroll Effect (Aryan Dzn Style):

Create a 'GTX Work' section with a 2-column or 3-column grid of YouTube thumbnails.

The Animation: Implement a 3D Perspective Tilt effect on each thumbnail card using useScroll and useTransform.

Scroll Down: As the user scrolls down, the cards must tilt backward on the X-axis (Rotation X) from 0° to -15°.

Scroll Up: When scrolling back up, they should smoothly return to 0°.

Smoothing: Use a spring transition (stiffness: 100, damping: 30) for a fluid, high-end feel.

Perspective: Ensure the parent container has perspective: 1200px to make the 3D depth look realistic.

3. Section Content:

Home: Grid of 6 thumbnails (use placeholder images with 'GTX' titles for now).

About: A clean, centered text section with the bio: 'I am a professional GFX designer with 3+ years of experience specializing in high-CTR YouTube thumbnails and gaming brand identities.'

Contact: A modern form with 'Name', 'Reason for Contact', and 'Message' fields. Style it with minimal borders and a sleek submit button.

4. New Feature: Client-Admin Direct Chat Page:

Tab Trigger: The 'Chat' tab in the navbar should open a dedicated chat page/view.

Chat Interface: Design a simple, intuitive chat interface similar to Discord's direct message layout. It should include:

A main chat window to display messages.

An input field for typing messages.

A 'Send' button.

User Status Indicators: Implement a visible status for the Admin (you).

Online: Green dot/icon next to 'Admin'.

Offline: Grey dot/icon next to 'Admin'.

Do Not Disturb (DND): Red dot/icon next to 'Admin'.

Initial State: Default to 'Online' or 'Offline' for demo.

Real-time Communication: Use Socket.IO to enable real-time message exchange between the client (website visitor) and the Admin.

Backend: Create a simple Node.js/Express server that handles WebSocket connections via Socket.IO for message broadcasting and user status management.

Admin Panel (Simplified): For demonstration, assume a basic way to toggle admin status (Online/Offline/DND) on the server side or from a simple mock-up.

Message History: For demo, a basic in-memory message history (not persistent across reloads) is acceptable.

5. Technical Requirements:

Full Stack Project: Configure Replit as a full-stack project with separate frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express).

Use React Router or state-based switching for tab navigation.

Ensure the entire site is 100% responsive for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.

Set up the Contact form to be 'Ready to Connect' with an email service like EmailJS."
